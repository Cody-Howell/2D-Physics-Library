# Direction-Library
Contains a few well-tested classes to handle rotations and velocities (in Radians or degrees).

It will (in the future) also have object definitions, raycasting for testing overlaps, and some more. Meant for 2D line-based games.

Read the wiki (which has links to the package) and get a bunch of class definitions! [Those exist here](https://wiki.codyhowell.dev/2dphysicslibrary).
