# 2D Physics Library

This is a junior-in-school's first public library. As of now, it contains the Rotation class, a well-tested and 
defined method for working with coordinates on a 2D plane. It gets and sets Radians and Angles (with accuracy of 1 degree), 
provides X and Y coordinates of the unit circle, and can be assigned to point at some arbitrary point in space. A few more 
methods will be defined for this class.

In the future, this package will have a number of additional classes that right now are focused on top-down 2D programs 
(that don't generally have to deal with a downward force such as gravity). It will take care of raycasting, object 
line definitions, overlaps, and maybe include some math classes to calculate more complex physics interactions. 

I add XML Comments (the ones VS Code and Visual Studio usually read for their Intellisense) to every property, method, and class, 
so I hope those are of a bit more use to you than a generalized readme. I also intend to add an external documentation page 
for all the classes and methods I generate here. That is for some future day, though.
